# Python_Lesson_Modules
Lessons for Python beginners hoping to gain exposure to math and coding
concepts in an accessible manor

This project is a work in progress. Each lesson will eventually have an
unfinished version to guide users through building up a working version
of the program. The completed python scripts in this repository should
serve as a solution key.
